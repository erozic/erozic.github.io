Hi there! My name is Eugen Rožić (that's me on the right) and I am currently an aspiring (high-)school teacher looking for a job in or around Zagreb.
<br>
A short overview of my life is that I have completed a 3-year bachelor in computing, a 2-year master in ICT/CS <!--(<a href="https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en" target="_blank">FER</a>)--> and also a 5-year integrated master in research-oriented physics <!--(<a href="http://www.pmf.unizg.hr/phy/en" target="_blank">PMF</a>)--> at the University of Zagreb, all with distinction and honours.  After that I've been a PhD student at UCL, London, for a year and half, terminated that prematurely and will shortly be gaining teaching (pedgogical-psyhcological) competences.
More about my qualifications and experience can be found in my resume (left). For those who like its design I've prepared a documented template that should be relatively easily adaptable by an average LaTeX user.

<h4>My name</h4>
<p>
Croatian is a bit of a difficult and weird language for most people, a typical Slavic language. What is good about it is that it has phonological ortography, meaning basically that every letter has a sound and only that sound, regardless of its position in a word. So if you know how to pronounce "e", "u", "g" and "n" in Croatian then you know how to say my name! This is why I wrote my name in IPA and made it a link to a pronunciation guide for English. Anyway, this is all just for fun and learning, you can go ahead and just call me /juːdʒiːn/ (Eugene in English).
