Hi there! My name is Eugen (that's me on the right) and I am currently a teacher of electrical engineering, electronics, informatics and other technical subjects in the <a href="http://www.ss-zrakoplovna-rperesina-vg.skole.hr/" target="_blank">Rudolf Perešin Aviation Technical School</a> and in the process of gaining teaching (pedagogical) competences at the Faculty of humanities and social sciences of the University of Zagreb in order to become a full-fledged teacher by vocation.
<br>
A short overview of my life so far is that I have completed a 3-year bachelor in computing, a 2-year master in ICT/CS <!--(<a href="https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en" target="_blank">FER</a>)--> and a 5-year integrated master in research-oriented physics <!--(<a href="http://www.pmf.unizg.hr/phy/en" target="_blank">PMF</a>)--> at the University of Zagreb, all with distinction and honours.  After graduating physics I spent a year and a half on a postgraduate program in biophysics at UCL London which I terminated prematurely and returned to Zagreb in order to achieve what I felt, and still feel, is my calling. However, during that year and a half I have made some interesting results and I'm still working on the subject in the hope of turning those results into scientific papers and a PhD in the near future. The subject of my master thesis in physics carries a similar story and hope. More about my dealings with science can be found on the <a href="/hr/research/">research</a> subpage.
<br>
Beside pedagogy and science there are many things that interest me and keep me occupied. Among them the most prominent of the intellectual kind are politics and philosophy, in the realm of art it's music and in the sports and general pastime category alpine climbing and tournament poker have occupied most of my time and attention in the last couple of years.
<br>
More about my qualifications, various experience and me personally can be found in my CV (link on the left of this text)- For those who like the format and design of the CV I have prepared a documented template that an average LaTeX user should be able to adapt to their needs relatively easily.

<h4>My name</h4>
<p>
Croatian is a bit of a difficult and weird language for most people, a typical Slavic language. What is good about it is that it has phonological orthography, meaning basically that every letter has a sound and only that sound, regardless of its position in a word. So if you know how to pronounce "e", "u", "g" and "n" in Croatian then you know how to say my name! This is why I wrote my name in IPA and made it a link to a pronunciation guide for English. Anyway, this is all just for fun and learning, you can go ahead and just call me /juːdʒiːn/ (Eugene in English).
