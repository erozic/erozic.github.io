Hi there!  
My name is Eugen, I'm a physicist and a computer scientist by vocation and a school teacher by practice and calling. Ideally I see myself as a physics teacher on a secondary school level because I think and feel that it best fits my abilities, knowledge and interests, but I'm temporarily unemployed in order to be able to, among other things, still do a little more science.  
To survive I'm currently open to giving tutoring (in physics, mathematics, informatics and all things related) to anyone who needs it. If you (or your child) are in that group please be free to contact me by e-mail.

A short overview of my academic life so far is that I have completed a 3-year bachelor in computing, a 2-year master in ICT/CS <!--[FER](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en){: target="_blank"}--> and a 5-year integrated master in research-oriented physics <!--[PMF](http://www.pmf.unizg.hr/phy/en){: target="_blank"}--> at the University of Zagreb. After that I spent a year and a half on a postgraduate program in biophysics at UCL London which I terminated prematurely and returned to Zagreb in order to achieve what I felt, and still feel, is my calling.  
After my return from London I started teaching in croatian schools, acquired pedagogical competences and became a certified school teacher by passing the state exam in 2020. Since then I've been more-or-less constantly employed as a teacher, with minor excursions into science with which I still have a loose relationship.  
Among many other things that interest me and that I have dabbled in during my life, currently the most prominent are political philosophy, and history and philosophy of science and education, in the intellectual realm, in the realm of art it's almost exclusively music (in various passive and active forms) and in the sports and recreation category it is climbing and hiking, and karting and F1.

More (information, thoughts, useful materials etc.) about the more important aspects of my life can be found on dedicated subpages (links on the top of the page), and more details about my qualifications, various work and volunteering experiences and me personally can be found in my [CV](/files/CV_full_engl.pdf){: target="_blank"}.  
For those who like the format and design of the CV I have prepared a documented [template](/files/CV_template.zip){: target="_blank"} that an average LaTeX user should be able to adapt to their needs relatively easily.

#### My name

Croatian is a bit of a difficult and weird language for most people, a typical Slavic language. What is good about it is that it has phonological orthography, meaning basically that every letter has a sound and only that sound, regardless of its position in a word. So if you know how to pronounce "e", "u", "g" and "n" in Croatian then you know how to say my name! This is why I wrote my name in IPA and made it a link to a pronunciation guide for English. Anyway, this is all just for fun and learning, you can go ahead and just call me /juːdʒiːn/ (Eugene in English).
