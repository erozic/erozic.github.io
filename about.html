Hi there! My name is Eugen Rožić (that's me on the right) and I am a recent physics, and a not-so-recent ICT/computer science graduate currently looking for something research-like or research-related to do (a job or a PhD) in or around London.
<br>
A short overview of my qualifications is that I have completed a 3-year bachelor in computing and a 2-year master in ICT <!--(<a href="https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en" target="_blank">FER</a>)-->, and also a 5-year integrated master in research-oriented physics <!--(<a href="http://www.pmf.unizg.hr/phy/en" target="_blank">PMF</a>)--> at the University of Zagreb, all with distinction and honours.  You can find more about my qualifications and experience in my <a href="/files/Eugen_Rozic_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> <span style="font-size:0.9em;">[and if you like its design please help yourself to the <a href="/files/Eugen_Rozic_CV_template.zip"><span id="LaTeX">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> template</a> :]</span>
</p>

<h3>Professional and research interests</h3>
<p>
My interests in physics during studying were primarily theoretical and fundamental with a strong inclination towards mathematics. Currently what interests me the most from those areas are the conceptual issues of Quantum Mechanics and QFT, but this is not something I think I want to pursue professionally. On a more practical, or rather a more down-to-earth side, I am attracted to the <b>physics of complex</b>, and especially <b>biological systems</b>. My master thesis (you can find it under "<a href="/research/">Research</a>") was in the related area of complex networks, although on a very general and fundamental level.
</p><p>
During my bachelor in computing and master in ICT my biggest interests were also in the more fundamental areas and those closely related to mathematics such as the theory of computation, <b>functional programming, optimisation</b> (linear and metaheuristics) and <b>AI/machine learning</b>. Although my formal modules were <i>information processing</i> (bachelor) and <i>telecommunication and informatics</i> (master), I have taken all possible courses related to those areas as elective ones (all from the CS module) which is why I usually add "computer science" to my qualifications.
</p><p>
Finally, although I have never studied it explicitly I have a great interest in mathematics and have, during my studies, touched upon a rather large variety of areas. Alongside the standard basic areas for computer science and physics I have taken additional courses in <b>advanced linear algebra</b> (vector spaces, group theory), <b>stochastic processes</b>, <b>graph theory</b>, topology and differential geometry. Currently my biggest interest in "pure" mathematics is <b>logic and probability</b>, specifically the ideas of E. T. Jaynes (<a href="http://bayes.wustl.edu/" target="_blank">The Logic of Science</a>) and the work of Kurt Gödel.
<p>

<h3>Programming and computers</h3>
<p>
My main languages are <b>Java</b> and <b>Python</b>, with Python being the favourite but Java being the one I have a lot more experience with and knowledge of. Beside those two I have also used <b>C</b> (I learned procedural programming on it) and <b>Scala</b> (I learned functional programming on it).
</p><p>
<!--
The biggest system I designed and implemented in Java was the ~10K LoC multi-threaded, multi-process, high-throughput publish-subscribe system for my master thesis (which you can find under "<a href="/research/">Research</a>") that is now the basis of the <a href="https://github.com/OpenIotOrg/openiot/tree/develop/modules/CUPUS" target="_blank">OpenIoT CUPUS module</a>.
-->
Descriptions of my bigger projects can be found in the Appendix part of my <a href="/files/Eugen_Rozic_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>, and some examples of my programming in the repositories on my <a href="https://github.com/erozic" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.
</p><p>
My IDE of choice is <b>Eclipse</b>, which I have been using both on Windows and Linux since 2009. I use it for Java, Python and LaTeX and have used it before for C and Scala also.
</p><p>
My OS of choice is currently <b>Linux/Ubuntu</b> and I think I get around it pretty decently, including using basic scripting with <kbd>bash</kbd>.
</p>

<h3>Me as a person</h3>
<p>
As all people I am a lot of things and its hard to reduce oneself to only a few characteristics. But if I had to choose I would say that I am a very systematic person, good at organising things, and also extremely focused and dedicated when I work on something. Optimisation is in my blood which sometimes results in too much time spent on non-crucial stuff but also means that when I do something it's done properly.
</p><p>
I enjoy my alone time, thinking and working, but I am also a very social person and comfortable in social interactions. I can function efficiently as part of a group and I'm also good at managing and organising other people.
</p><p>
Music is very important to me, spiritually so to say. Something is always playing in my head, I often sing or whistle (although I tend to do that discreetly). I mostly listen to rock, blues, jazz and classical music, with a general tendency for older and easier stuff. Although I finished 6 years of elementary music school learning the piano, I think it would be a stretch to say I play the piano. However, I am comfortable saying I play the drums.
</p><p>
Generally I am a person of very wide interests, but there are two more subjects that stand out: philosophy and education. Regarding the latter, I believe that I have a talent for teaching and I would love to make it my profession eventually.
</p><p>
When I'm not relaxing and/or reading I go free climbing, preferably in nature, or play poker. I almost exclusively play live poker tournaments because I consider that a game, a sport more than gambling, in which I work on the ability to control and beat myself and where I test and train the ability to assess others.
</p>
<h4>My name</h4>
<p>
Croatian is a bit of a difficult and weird language for most people, a typical Slavic language. What is good about it is that it is completely phonetic, meaning basically that every letter has a sound and only that sound, regardless of its position in a word. So if you know how to pronounce "e", "u", "g" and "n" in Croatian then you know how to say my name! This is why I wrote my name in IPA and made it a link to a pronunciation guide for English. Anyway, this is all just for fun and learning, you can go ahead and just call me /juːdʒiːn/ (Eugene in English) :)
